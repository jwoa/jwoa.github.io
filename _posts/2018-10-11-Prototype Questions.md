title: Questions for Prototype
---

## Statement
What would be different about the way we use computers if they had personalities and responded to world events?

* Would you want your computer to be reactive to things currently happening in the world?
* How would you feel about your computer trying to "take care of you‚Äù?
* What types of input can I use to build the computers persona?
* In what type of world do you see a device like this existing in?
* If you could interact with your computer in any way what would that look like? 

### Q's for me
* What am I making?
* Why am I making it?
* Who am I making it for?
* How am I making it?
* What do I hope to get out of this prototype process?
