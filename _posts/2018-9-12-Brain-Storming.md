### Question
What does the future of Human Computer Interaction look like?

### Response
HCI interests me because it’s changed dramatically from when it was first introduced but has since plateaued. The shift has switched to how we interact with the mobile platforms and devices in our house hold. We have  interacted with the web in the same way since it’s inception and I want to change that. However, I want to do this without widening the gap between the more advanced countries and those with less. That’s why I’m choosing the web as the base for the next stage of HCI.

### Feedback
- Be more specific and how people interact to browse with the web.
- What medium of the “interaction” am I going to go with.

What does the future of Human Computer Interaction look like when it comes to the web?

### Updated Response 
I’m a web developer and as such I spend a lot of time on the computer, which led to me having a brief encounter with carpal tunnel. It made me think about how we interact with our computers and with the web in particular, seeing as thats what I spend the most time on. We have  interacted with the web in the same way since it’s inception and I want to change that. All my life I’ve watched cartoons, shows, and movies that depict a future full of innovation and futuristic computers. I want to create a way of interaction between web browsers and people that doesn’t require the user to touch the mouse at all when navigating a site. Mobile devices have done a magnificent job of changing how we interact with them over the years. Today we can unlock, command, and browse through our phones with our voices or gestures. Why can’t we do the same with such an open platform like the web?
