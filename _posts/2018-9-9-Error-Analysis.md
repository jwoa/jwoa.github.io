title: Error Analysis
---

List all the things that can go wrong when using a product or having an experience. This is a good way to understand how design mitigates or contributes to inevitable human errors and other failures.

### Exercise
Imagine various scenarios in which your product would be used. Don’t limit yourself to ideal spaces for your product but also think about the most obscure spaces. How do these spaces effect your product? What about the elements in these spaces that you can’t control? (Sound, lighting, weather etc) 

Think about the extreme emergency scenarios too, for example, if you’re designing a laptop think about how it would be used in rain or on a cramped subway. 

### Feedback
- Only mentioned physical things.
- What about culturally?
- What about other things like social, psychological etc?
- Expand and think about way the product can fail.
