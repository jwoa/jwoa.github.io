        Hey there, I'm a front-end web developer and designer who loves making things. For the last two years I've worked at a multicultural marketing agency named <a href="http://boogie.co" class="boogie">boogie </a>and I've gotten the opportunity to work on a multitude of websites.

        In each of the websites below my role included sketching out the initial concept, wireframing, mockups, and coding the site. Click on an image to be taken to the site and experience it yourself.
