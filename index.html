            Hey, I'm <span class="name"><mark>Jason Agyekum</mark></span> and Iâ€™m a full stack developer in the process of recieving my MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design. My focus is on the future of human computer interaction and what that relationship looks like as machines get smarter. Especially, what it looks like if they're programmed with human biases.
<br><br>
Design and code have taught me new ways of problem-solving all while expanding my creative view on how things can better operate. I want to mix design with technology to create new and innovative ways to do things and solve problems.
