                What does it feel like when we are profiled and discriminated against by machines?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                DAIQUAN is an AI powered kiosk that takes the users personal information and tries
                to make their travel experience safer by screening for possible threats or harassment
                by local officials. It uses biased data for good.

                For this project I focused on some of the more popular API's that are currently available and
                used for facial recognition. These include Amazon's Rekognition, Face++, Microsoft's Azure, and
                IBM's Watson. The data that's extracted from each of these API's is then evaluated and compiled
                by DAIQUAN and used to rank the user.

                    The form was not hard for me to come up with. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to
                    build something that related to transportation and data. Different places treat people differently
                    based on the culture of that environment and how people are generally profiled. The idea for a kiosk
                    came from the ticket machines that you see all over NYC in various train stations and bus ports.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    The sketches above show a wide range of some of the ideas I had initially gone through. This was when
                    I was considering the input factor above everything else. The way the user interacts with the application
                    was vital as it spoke to how the AI and the user interacted. The first form of the application required
                    the user to submit social media information as part of the classification process but this raised some problems.
                    Collecting the data from the accounts proved to be a bit problematic as it eleminated all those who didn't have
                    a social media presence.

                <br/>
                <p>
                    Above is a simple mockup of what the initial interface looked like. I wanted the project to also take in bio data
                    and use that as part of the evaluation. This idea came to me when I was traveling and saw the Clear Kiosks all over
                    the secuirty portion of the airport. Here was a company that was using biometric information and data to process people
                    and grant them/deny them access through the airport. My inital form factor was going to be a replicate of the Clear kiosk
                    but I thought it best to change course and add my own flair to the project.

                The video above is an example of DAIQUAN in action. The video shows the application from the front-end perspective
                of the user and what they would experience. The user begins the process by entering their name and then pressing begin,
                after that DAIQUAN does the rest of the work. It snaps a photo of the user and then runs that image through the various
                API's that it's connected to. After that it builds a profile of the user and then asks them to confirm some information
                before moving forward. Once the user cofirms or denys the application then prepares the results of how they will be profiled
                and loads up ads that are targeted to the user. Based on just the visual information that it was able to collect.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/daiquan/systemflow.png" />
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As seen in the chart above the application has just a few functions but each one works towards building the complete profile.
                The most important one is the function that builds the profile. It takes various things into account such as what the person is wearing,
                their gender, race, age, and even if they are wearing lipstick or have a beard. All of this is then compiled into a profile and then
                based on the final output it is compared with the crime statistics of NY giving the user a sense of how they'd be treated in NY.
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/daiquan/data.png" />
                The profile is stored as a JSON file and DAIQUAN reads this file and generates a reciept for the user with all the inforation that was collected
                as well as wether or not they are flagged as a safety threat. The user can scan the barcode on the bottom of the reciept to learn more about the
                project.

            <h3 class="sub_title">Branding for this Century</h3>
            <p>
                So I'm building an application that uses AI and data to warn people about certain exposure and harrasment that they may recieve,
                how would this be branded? Will it have a serious tone or be more friendly? What generation is it geared towards? As I sat and
                thought about this on the train I came across a realization. A lot of the companies that I was seeing advertisements for had a similar
                approach as far as design and branding goes. It was as if they all shared the same agency. So I modeled the branding for DAIQUAN to look
                somewhat similar to theirs.
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/daiquan/web_branding.png" />
                Now that I had the general look down I started to think about the culture of these places and how some of them just may be trying too hard
                to fit in or be inclusive. You see it all the time online, companies are constantly being "cancelled" for their neglegent approach to advertising
                campaigns that often end up being offensive in one way ot another to a particular group of people.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/daiquan/stereotypes.png" />
                <br/>
                In order to replicate that pattern I programmed the loading/advertisement page to show specific content based on what the user was profiled as.
                These stereotypes come from my own personal experience as well as speaking with people from different backgrounds and ethnicities who told me
                how they often get misclassified and judged by people. So what DAIQUAN is trying to do is serve the user an ad that they might like based on the
                steroetypical data DAIQUAN has about this user.
