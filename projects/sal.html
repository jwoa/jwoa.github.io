        <p>If machines are being run on biased data what does that mean for the future of humanity? Especially for those who are targeted?
        <br/>
        SAL demonstrates the dangers of biased data in technology. It watches and examines the user all throughout the project and judges them based on corrupt datasets. The goal of this project is to highlight and stress the importance of human bias in datasets and what that could mean when it comes to the future of technology.</p>

            <h3>Logo Variations</h3>
            <p>It took me quite some time before settling on the purple colorway for the logo. Green is primarily representative of health and blue tends to be used throughout social media companies and for water so I went with purple. One that just simply appeals to me personally and doesn't associate with any health stigmas.</p>

            </div>
        
            <p>Some other alternatives for the logo including fruit and vegetabke varitions. Some composed of a smooth font with an avacado pit to replace the O's etc but they all became too abstract and strayed away from the point.</p>

            <h3>Initial Drafts</h3>
                <p>Initially I wanted to have a one page design with the information displayed but the format became very cluttered when prototyping. So, after some revision I settled on a single page with tabs to display different pieces of information relative to the user. This is currently what I've settled on but it is subject to change and I will update this page if it does.</p>
                <p>I began with some initial sketches of the main pages of the application. They are all very simple and place the focus of the page on the information that is being delivered. These (very rough) sketches were done on my iPad using an app called Paper.</p>

            <h3>First Prototype</h3>
                <p>After the first round of sketches I moved on to creating a more thorough design. This hi-fidelity protoype made getting my point/vision across easier. I also included the page for contacting your local representative which I believe would be a very important part of the application. Having the ability to request change should be effortless.</p>

            <h3>Final Solution (Still in Progress)</h3>
                <p>At it's current state the web application is functional but not enough to be deployed. I am working on gathering the right databases to query for the results. It has been an interesting experience and one that has definetely taught me new things as far as building web applications go.</p>
