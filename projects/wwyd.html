        <p class="about_me">I always loved that question. I built this mini site out of pure curiousity and the urge to compile a zine of what people would do in certain circumstances. I decided to create a site that asks the visitor a new question each day and doesn't take any personal information about them. I'm going to launch this site in January of 2019 and everyday I'm going to collect all the answers and compile them into a zine for people to have.
