<!-- "Intro" -->
<p class="about_me">I spent the last few months working on my thesis and bringing it to life through prototypes. A lot of research, self exploration, and tetsing went into <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/sal">SAL</a>, which was the form for my first semester prototype. Below is some of my project documentation that I kept through the course. I'm going to keep this page updated as my spring semester goes along. </p>

<!-- Abstract -->

<h1 class="title">Thesis One: Final Deliverables ~ Fall 2018</h3>
<h3 class="sub_title">Abstract</h3>
<p class="about_me">If machines are being run on biased data what does that mean for the future of humanity? Especially for those who are targeted?
<br/>
<br/>
SAL demonstrates the dangers of biased data in technology. It watches and examines the user all throughout the project and judges them based on corrupt datasets. The goal of this project is to highlight and stress the importance of human bias in datasets and what that could mean when it comes to the future of technology.</p>

<!-- Thoughts + Goals-->
<h3 class="sub_title">Thoughts & Goals</h3>
<p class="about_me">The questions that are really fueling me throughout this process are a mixture of personal and ethical thoughts and ideas. As a black creative who is interested in machine learning I can not help but think of the dangers of misidentification or biased data in machines. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have been automating our lives and making things easier. What happens when devices are unintentionally fed biased data?</p>

<span class="resume_desc">
    <ul>
        <li>Would the developer or the company be held responsible?</li>
        <li>What groups of people would suffer the most from something like this?</li>
        <li>As a developer, what am I doing about this problem that I care so much about?</li>
        <li>I know how my personal connection to this but how can I express that to the users?</li>
        <li>How blatant or subtle should the biases be?</li>
        <li>What form can get this across without losing the user?</li>
    </ul>
</span>

<p class="resume_desc">In the end I believe that through his experience the users will leave with a feeling of understanding, empathy, or contemplation. To show this I am building a TSA system that demonstrates the problem and having the user experience it first hand through the process. Depending on who is taking it their results will vary. By placing the power in the hands of the system I'm replicating the power that TSA agents have over travelers.

<br/>
I am making this to highlight the importance of accurate representation in data and technology. I experience acts of micro-aggression and racism all the time. Like many other minorities I've noticed that it changes based on where I am and what I'm wearing. I constantly think about the future and what it will be like, both the good and the bad. If machines are programmed by people with certain biases or feelings towards others what does that future feel like? As a creative I can't help but think about the implications of the things I'm creating and who I'm creating them for.
<br/>
<br/>
The goal of this project is to let people see a side of technology that they don't usually see. Unless you are interested in it you wouldn't really know how your data is being used on you or how you are being classified. I want people to be aware of this and how dangerous it can be if used incorrectly against a specific group of people. We've already seen this sort of classification and treatment being rolled out in various nations like the US (Muslim ban) and China (Social ranking).</p>

<!-- Research -->
<h3 class="sub_title">Research</h3>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sal/sal_research.png" />
<p class="about_me">I am studying the possible dangers of biased data in machines. I chose this because as someone who experiences micro-aggressions and racism I worry about what will happen when people teach machines this behavior. They may not do it intentionally and that's even scarier. I spent the last three months exploring what the future could possibly feel like for someone like me.  
<br/>
<br/>
My domains of this research and interest for this project varied a lot throughout the last few months. As my ideas and concepts shifted some domains came and left but two always remained. Human-Computer Interaction and Biased Data. Aside from the personal reasons, I'm interested in this area because I'm a developer and it is something that I must hold myself accountable for as well. Speaking to people and visiting museums/researching work have been my greatest source of information and knowledge. The trip to the Whitney Museum in particular has proven to be the most helpful.
